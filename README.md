# VaadinWithSpringExample
This is interesting sample spring example which uses Vaadin front end components. I wrote this sample program inspired by these guidelines:

https://spring.io/guides/gs/crud-with-vaadin/#scratch

Everybody knows that Vaadin is very popular component based java framework. On the other Spring is another really powerful backend framework. So, this example combines the power of both frameworks for easy and faster development. We could implement webservice or spring MVC, but we need to write codes in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, these languages makes the code a Mess! So, with these combination we do not need to write any html or javascript programs, everything is java, easy to maintain.

**How to Run**
* It is a gradle project and we can directly import this project in eclipse IDE and run it using the startup file 
_Application.java_.
* Or we can build this project to create an executable java file.
* Or we can create a deployable WAR file, which can be directly deployed into a Tomcat or Jetty server. 
* This application uses builtin spring database h2db to test.
